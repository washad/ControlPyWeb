Description: # ControlPyWeb
        A project to facilitate easy read/write to the ControlByWeb line of Automation/SCADA IO products. 
        
        
        ## Description
        Xytronic Research makes a handy line of remote IO products useful for home and industrial 
        automation. Interacting with these modules generally requires the use 
        of a url library such as requests, and then requires dissecting the response to be dissected
        and processed. While not terribly difficult to do, it is repetitive. 
        
        This module seeks to abstract out some of that effort in a thought out and tested way. 
        
        ## Installation
        pip install controlpyweb
        
        
        ## Usage
        The basis of functionality is the WebIOModule class. It both acts as a container for individual
        IO and handles interaction with the hardware.

        class X404DigitalIn(WebIOModule):   # Name the class whatever you like
            StartButton = DiscreteIn("Start Button", "startButton")
            StopButton = DiscreteIn("Stop Button", "stopButton")
            DoorClosed = DiscreteIn("Door Closed", "doorClosed")
        
        
        class X410DigitalOut(WebIOModule):
            StartLamp = DiscreteOut("Start Lapm", "redLamp")
            MaintLight = DiscreteOut("Maintenance Lamp", "lamp1")
        
        
        digital_in = X404DigitalIn("192.168.1.1")
        relay_out = X410DigitalOut("192.168.1.2")
        
        
        digital_in.update_from_module()
        
        relay_out.StartLamp = digital_in.StartButton
        relay_out.MaintLight = not digital_in.DoorClosed
        
        relay_out.send_changes_to_module()
        ~~~~
        
        Though it is possible to do immediate reads/writes, the most efficient pattern is to first to 
        do an update from the module, make all changes, then send the results.
